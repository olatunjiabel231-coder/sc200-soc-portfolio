# Windows Server Onboarding to Microsoft Sentinel

This section documents the onboarding of an on-premises **Windows Server 2022 virtual machine** to Microsoft Sentinel as part of the **Project 0 – SOC Environment Setup**.

This step extends the SOC lab by integrating a locally hosted server with Azure monitoring services using **Azure Arc** and the **Azure Monitor Agent (AMA)**.

---

## Relationship to Project 0

This onboarding process builds on the SOC infrastructure created in **Project 0**.

➡️ Return to the main project documentation:  
[Project 0 – SOC Environment Setup](../README.md)

Project 0 established the following components:

- Microsoft Entra ID tenant
- Log Analytics Workspace
- Microsoft Sentinel SIEM
- Initial SOC monitoring environment

This section focuses on **connecting an on-premises server to that environment**.

---

## Objective

Demonstrate how an on-premises system can be integrated into a cloud-based SOC monitoring pipeline.

The goal is to collect **Windows Security Event logs** from a locally hosted server and analyze them using **Microsoft Sentinel**.

## Technologies Used

- VMware Workstation
- Windows Server 2022
- Microsoft Azure
- Azure Arc
- Azure Monitor Agent (AMA)
- Log Analytics Workspace
- Microsoft Sentinel
- Kusto Query Language (KQL)

## Implementation Steps

1. Deploy **Windows Server 2022** virtual machine in VMware.
2. Install the **Azure Arc agent** on the server.
3. Connect the server to **Azure Arc**.
4. Install the **Azure Monitor Agent (AMA)** extension.
5. Configure a **Data Collection Rule** to collect Windows Security Events.
6. Send logs to the **Log Analytics Workspace**.
7. Verify logs ingestion in **Microsoft Sentinel**.

## Outcome

The Windows Server VM was successfully onboarded into the SOC monitoring environment.

Security logs from the on-premises system are now ingested into **Microsoft Sentinel**, enabling detection engineering and threat investigation using **KQL queries**.
